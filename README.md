# Query Fan-Out Analysis Tool

A powerful Streamlit application that uses Google's Query Fan-Out methodology to help you optimize content for AI-powered search results and Google AI Overviews.

## 🚀 Features

### Two Analysis Modes:

1. **New Content Planning** 
   - Generate query variants using Google's Fan-Out system
   - Plan comprehensive content strategies
   - Identify content gaps before writing
   - Create topic clusters and content hierarchies

2. **Optimize Existing Content**
   - Analyze any URL for optimization opportunities
   - Compare against target keywords
   - Identify missing query coverage
   - Get specific rewrite recommendations
   - Competitive analysis against other URLs

## 🎯 Query Fan-Out Methodology

Based on [Google's Query Fan-Out System](https://dejan.ai/blog/googles-query-fan-out-system-a-technical-overview/), this tool generates 7 types of query variants:

- **Equivalent Queries** - Alternative ways to ask the same question
- **Follow-up Queries** - Logical next questions
- **Generalization Queries** - Broader topic versions
- **Canonicalization Queries** - Standardized search terms
- **Entailment Queries** - Logically implied questions
- **Specification Queries** - More detailed versions
- **Clarification Queries** - Intent clarification

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### New Content Planning:
- Start with 5-10 core queries
- Include both broad and specific queries
- Consider user intent variations
- Think about the customer journey

### Content Optimization:
- Use your main target keyword
- Include 3-5 related keywords
- Add 2-3 competitor URLs for comparison
- Ensure URLs are publicly accessible
- Review all recommendations before implementing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Content fetching fails:**
- Check if the URL is publicly accessible
- Verify the site doesn't block web scrapers
- Try a different URL from the same domain

**Gemini API errors:**
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check API quotas and limits
- Try using a different model (Flash vs Pro)

**Analysis takes too long:**
- Reduce analysis depth
- Use fewer query variants
- Choose Flash model for faster processing
